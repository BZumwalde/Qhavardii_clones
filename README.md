# Qhavardii_clones
Repository for Zumwalde and Hoban code for analyzing spatial extent, clustering and diversity of clones within Q havardii populations across its geographic range

This will contain genotype files, primarily using data from Zumwalde et al 2021 and Zumwalde et al 2022, with additional populations sampled since.
It will also contain code for calculating distances among clonal ramets within a given clone, and calculating other diversity measures
